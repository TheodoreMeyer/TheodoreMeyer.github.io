# Simple Voice Geyser
- Simple Voice Geyser is a lightweight Bukkit plugin that lets Bedrock players on Geyser servers use Simple Voice Chat, even though they can’t install client-side mods. 
- It’s made for servers that want both Java and Bedrock players to be able to use proximity voice chat with no extra setup for players.
