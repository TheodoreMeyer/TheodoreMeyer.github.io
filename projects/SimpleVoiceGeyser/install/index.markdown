---

   * Fabric: place the `.jar` in `mods/`

3. Install dependencies:

   * Simple Voice Chat
   * GeyserMC
   * Optional: Floodgate, LuckPerms (Fabric)

4. Start or restart your server

5. Verify startup:

---

## Server Configuration

The plugin is configured via:
```yaml
client:

   # default: 30
   # Timeout in seconds
   # WARNING: Developer Has disabled this for right now.
   vctimeout: 30

   # default: 2
   # idle websocket timeout in minutes
   idletimout: 2

   # default: false
   # Only allow bedrock players to join the chat
   requireBedrock: false

   # default: true
   # Allows for the bedrock client to open a menu just by opening the emotes menu
   # WARNING: Make sure you have off-hand-emote turned off in geyser or there may
   #          be conflict
   useEmoteForSVG: true

server:

   group:

      # Settings for the default group for Svg players.
      default:

         # default: true
         # This decides whether the Svg group is created for players who use the website
         enabled: true

         # default: 1a2b
         # This control's the default groups's password.
         password: 1a2b

   # default: 8080
   # port server will run on.
   port: 8080

   # default: 0.0.0.0
   # Address server binds to, use 127.0.0.1 to only connect from host device.
   # This is suggested to be changed only if you are running a proxy on the same network/device as the server to allow https/wss.
   bind-address: 0.0.0.0

# default: false
# Debug logs
# Do NOT use this in production. This will very quickly fill up your server logs.
Debug: false
```

### Important Notes

* `vctimeout` is currently not enforced and may be removed or re-enabled later
* `useEmoteForSVG` may conflict with Geyser’s off-hand emote setting
* `bind-address` controls network exposure:

   * `0.0.0.0` → accessible externally
   * `127.0.0.1` → local only

---

## Networking & Security

Simple Voice Geyser uses a web-based client over HTTP/WebSocket.

### Important:

* Browsers **require HTTPS** for microphone access in most environments
* Running on plain HTTP may result in:

   * microphone access being blocked
   * connection failures

### Recommendation

Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Caddy) to provide:

* HTTPS (TLS)
* Secure WebSocket (WSS)

## Upgrading

Some versions may introduce breaking changes.

See:
https://theodoremeyer.github.io/projects/simplevoicegeyser/upgrading/

---

## Versioning Notes

* Versions not be ready for production use may be marked as `-DEV`.

---

## Troubleshooting

* Ensure all dependencies match supported versions
* Check server logs for startup errors
* Verify Geyser and Simple Voice Chat are functioning independently

If issues persist, open an issue on the GitHub repository with:

* server type (Paper / Fabric, etc.)
* plugin versions
* logs

---

## Notes

* This plugin extends Simple Voice Chat; it does not replace it

* It does not provide voice chat on its own

* As of 0.0.2-DEV:

   * Audio is not encoded
   * The server runs over HTTP by default

This makes using HTTPS strongly recommended for real deployments.
