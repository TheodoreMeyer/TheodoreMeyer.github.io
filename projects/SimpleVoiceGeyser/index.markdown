# Simple Voice Geyser

Simple Voice Geyser is a Bukkit plugin that lets Bedrock players on Geyser servers use Simple Voice Chat, even though they can’t install client-side mods.

It’s made for servers that want both Java and Bedrock players to be able to use proximity voice chat with no extra setup for players.

## What it does

- Allows Bedrock players to connect to Simple Voice Chat
- Works alongside GeyserMC
- No mods required for Bedrock players
- Simple, lightweight, and easy to install

## Requirements

- A Bukkit-based server (Paper, Spigot, etc.): 1.21.8 or later
- GeyserMC (optional)
- Simple Voice Chat 2.6.0 or later

This plugin does not replace Simple Voice Chat — it just extends it to support Bedrock players.

## Status

This project is being developed and open to feedback, issues, and contributions.
It is still in its Dev stage.
