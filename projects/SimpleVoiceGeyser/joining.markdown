## Joining the Voice Chat from the same device as Server
1. Go to your web browser and enter 127.0.0.1:web server port (default: 8080)

## Joining the Voice Chat from the local network
1. Go to (device ip4 address):(web server port).
    - Device ip4 address usually begins with 192.168.x.xxx
    - web server port default is 8080.

## Joining the Voice Chat from a different network
1. Make Sure the Server has either port-forwarded the server, or uses a tunneler/proxy like playit.gg
    - Only Difference from port forwarding with SVC is that this plugin uses TCP instead of UDP.

2. Get the IP address to join, and join via that.
